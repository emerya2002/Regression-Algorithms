# Linear Regression - Predictive Modeling for Stock Prices
- Our project aims to implement a linear regression model to solve a problem with real world applications.
- The problem we aim to address is predicting stock /prices and potentially recommending a stock to purchase based on given options. 
- Linear regression allows us to accurately predict prices by modeling the relationship between a dependent variable, which in case of predicting stock prices would usually be stock price or its potential returns.
- We also implement a Logistic regression model to compare and evaluate our prior model with.
